# Spring-Framework-5
This branch goes through component scan 

Section 5 of the guru course. 

# This is done the following way
1. First change the location of services folder into a place that the main cannot do scan in. 
2. Then specify in the main application @ComponentScan({}), and specify where Spring should do the scan.
